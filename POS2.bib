The first task evolves past years{'} inflection tasks by examining transfer of morphological inflection knowledge from a high-resource language to a low-resource language. This year also presents a new second challenge on lemmatization and morphological feature analysis in context. All submissions featured a neural component and built on either this year{'}s strong baselines or highly ranked systems from previous years{'} shared tasks. Every participating team improved in accuracy over the baselines for the inflection task (though not Levenshtein distance), and every team in the contextual analysis task improved on both state-of-the-art neural and non-neural baselines.",

Our model extends the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and incorporates the intuition that words’ distributions over tags, p(t|w), are sparse. In addition we introduce a model for determining the set of possible tags of a word which captures important dependencies in the ambiguity classes of words. Our model outperforms the best previously proposed model for this task on a standard dataset.},
