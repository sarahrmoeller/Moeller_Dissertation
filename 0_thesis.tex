\abstract{  \OnePageChapter	% because it is very short

About 40\% of the world's 7000+ languages are believed to be in danger of disappearing from human use by the end of this century \citet{eberhard_ethnologue:2020}. Many languages will disappear leaving almost no record of their existence because efforts to document and describe these languages are encountering an ``annotation bottleneck'' at early stages of analysis and annotation. Current annotation methods are too slow and expensive to counteract the pace of language endangerment and loss. Annotation could be sped and improved by machine learning. However, state-of-the-art supervised machine learning depends heavily on large amounts of annotated data. This dissertation examines methods for training machine learning systems on limited data and integrating those systems into the documentation and description of endangered languages, with a specific focus on morphological analysis. Unlike previous studies, this study applies machine learning models to nine typologically diverse languages. 

New methods for three tasks are explored. First, various methods are compared for automating morpheme segmentation and glossing.
Second, a new task is presented for learning morphological paradigms and automatically generating new morphological resources: IGT-to-paradigms (IGT2P). IGT2P demonstrates how existing human resources and computational methods can be exploited to solve the task with $21\%$ to $64\%$ accuracy. Third, the impact of POS tags on segmentation, glossing, and paradigm induction is examined, showing the presence or absence of POS tags does not have a significant bearing on the performance of machine learning systems. The largest average difference is an .09 improvement in F$_1$-scores by removing POS tags. These results are indicators that NLP may benefit from documentary linguistic data even when only limited annotated data exists for a language.

    This dissertation was supported by generous grants from the Institute of Cognitive Science (ICS), the Center for the Advancement of Teaching in Social Sciences (CARTSS), the Departmet of Linguistics at the University of Colorado Boulder, and by International Language and Development (ILAD). I am very grateful to Daniel Wilson who connected me with ILAD--an innovative organization with a meaningful \textit{raison d'etre}.
    
    I could not have done this without the valuable guidance, consistent support, and encouragement of my advisor Mans Hulden. Despite his workload, he never hurries through our meetings and he contributed to my success even beyond the helpful discussions about research. As an advisor he gave an ideal balance of expectations and independence. 
    
    My committee members all contributed more to this completed manuscript than just comments and suggestions. Martha Palmer 
    %provided several semesters of fellowships, insights from her broad experience, and down-to-earth encouragement. She
    gave simple, practical advice that, especially during my first year, made this journey easier. Andy's keen interest in computational methods for minority languages has been a great example of cross-disciplinary research and lifelong learning. Alexis has shown the spirit of a true teacher and mentor since we first crossed paths in Portugal and has been generous with her time and with my odd question about careers in academia. Without Katharina's insightful questions and pursuit of excellence, I'm not sure the IGT2P and POS chapters would have come to existence. 
		
    The quality of this work owes much to the other co-authors of the published versions of Chapters \ref{chap:IGT2P} and \ref{chap:POS}. Ling Liu was ready to listen to the vague idea and take on another project in the middle of her own PhD progress. I'm so glad Changbing Yang asked for more opportunities and I wish her the best as she starts her PhD. 
    
    Without the linguists, fieldworkers, and annotators who prepared the IGT, this work would not have been possible. Drs. Brenda Boerger, Shobhana Chelliah, Bernard Comrie, and Andy Cowell, as well as Chuck Donet, and Andrew Brumleve generously shared their field data. Yaghut added the missing Lezgi annotations. Mary Burke, Brenda, Andy, and Andrew also did the expert cleaning for the IGT2P experiments. Changbing and my undergraduate research assistants Zachary J. Ryan and Huilin Lin helped preprocess and reformat much of the data.
    
    I am so grateful for colleagues at CU Boulder who made time to talk about life and linguistics: Kristin, Katie, Irina, Annebeth, Adam, and of course my ever encouraging and upbeat cohort-mate Norielle. 
    
    Perhaps the biggest reasons I considered a career in academia were the examples set by Paul Kroeger, my MA advisor, and Michael Boutin, the head of the Applied Linguistics Department at Dallas International University. I didn't write a MA thesis, so this is my chance to acknowledge them. 
    %It wasn't just their academic guidance that inspired me. 
    My goal is to give others what they gave to me: the sense that every time I entered their offices that they had nothing more important in their overworked life than to listen to my rambling ideas and answer my half-formed questions. 
    
    Several other people from my Texas years encouraged me to head down this road. Among them, Brenda Boerger and Will Reiman are wonderful mentors and faithful friends whose Skype pings have meant so much the past several years.
    
	More than anyone, I am grateful for the support of my my family. They actually seem convinced everything I do is interesting and important. And I am obliged to my 16 nephews and nieces who kept me grounded by demanding, %``You are weird!" and 
	``If you're almost-a-doctor, how come you don't know the answer to all my questions?!"
